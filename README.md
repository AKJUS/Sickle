# Sickle

![alt text](./docs/logo/panda_logo.png)

Sickle is a tool I originally developed to help me be more effective, in both developing and understanding shellcode. However, throughout the course of its development and usage It has evolved into a payload development framework. Although current modules are mostly aimed towards assembly, this tool is not limited to shellcode.

Currently sickle can assist in the following.

- Converting assembly instructions to machine code (opcodes)
- Executing bytecode, including generated payloads
- Formatting opcodes for a target language
- Bad character identification
- Linear disassembly
- Diffing

## Shellcode Generation

Sickle supports shellcode generation via the [Keystone Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/). Due to this being a newly added feature, payload support is limited. However, the goal is to add a basic reverse shell for each architecture and platform.

## Diffing

Sickle includes a "diffing" module initially designed for analyzing shellcode stubs. The original "asm" mode performs linear disassembly diffs at both the assembly language and opcode levels separately.

In addition, Sickle offers various modes for performing diffs, making it useful beyond shellcode development.

## Shellcode Execution

One common task you may often perform is testing your shellcode. This process typically involves the following steps:

1. Compile the assembly language code.
2. Extract the shellcode and format it appropriately for your chosen wrapper.
3. Compile the wrapper.
4. Execute the wrapper.

Although these steps may seem minor, they can become time-consuming when done repeatedly. Sickle simplifies the process by automatically wrapping shellcode for quick testing, and the "run" module currently supports both Windows and Unix systems.

## Disassembly

Sickle can also convert a binary file into extracted opcodes (shellcode) and then translate those into machine instructions (assembly). Note that this process only works with raw binary files and currently performs disassembly in a linear fashion.

In the example shown above the "disassemble" module disassembles a reverse shell designed by Stephen Fewer to assembly.

## Shellcode Extraction

Shellcode extraction was the first module, or rather, the core functionality for Sickle, as opcodes are interpreted differently depending on the wrapper used. JavaScript, for example, does not store and interpret shellcode in the same way as a C program would.

Perhaps the biggest inspiration for this was `msfvenom`.

## Bad Character Identification

Although less common in 64-bit exploits, there may be instances where an exploit restricts the use of certain characters. This is where the "pinpoint" module excels, as it directly identifies and highlights the assembly instructions responsible for the identified bad character(s).

# Module Based Design

Originally, this tool started as a single large script. However, as it evolved, I found myself needing to re-learn the code with each update. To address this, Sickle now follows a modular approach, allowing for new functionality to be added with minimal time spent re-learning the toolâ€™s design.

Usage information for run

              Name: Shellcode Runner
            Module: run
      Architecture: Multi
          Platform: Multi
              Ring: 3

Author(s):

Tested against:
    Linux
    Windows

Description:
    
    Executes bytecode from a binary file (-r) or a payload module (-p) under the
    context of the currently running operating system and architecture. Meaning if
    you are running on AARCH64 bytecode will be interpreted as such and if your on
    x64 it will interpret it as x64 respectively.
    
Example:

    sickle.py -m run -r shellcode
```

This approach also includes documentation for shellcode stubs.

```
$ sickle -i -p linux/aarch64/shell_reverse_tcp

Description:
    
    TCP-based reverse shell over IPV4 that provides an interactive /bin/sh
    session. Since this payload is not staged, there is no need for anything
    more than a Netcat listener.

    src/sickle.py -p linux/aarch64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=1337 -f c
```
